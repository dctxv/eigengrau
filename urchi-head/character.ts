 * Urchi's head, on its own: the low-poly mesh painted into a canvas, with the random eye colourway.
 * Lifted from the Eigengrau site's character.ts, cut down to a head that is always awake: it nods
 * (the breath), blinks, tracks, and tilts or looks left and right. No spacesuit, sleep, stretch,
 * faces, or anything that reacts to music.
 *
 * What it does by itself (nothing to call): follows the pointer, breathes (a slow nod), tips its
 * head in curious tilts, darts its pupils, blinks (log-normal gaps, now and then twice).
 * What a host can ask of it on top: see UrchiCharacter below.
 *
 * `smooth` paints without pixels (anti-aliased, resolution set by the host); otherwise it is the
 * standalone page's small hard-pixel canvas. Query-string knobs work on any page:
